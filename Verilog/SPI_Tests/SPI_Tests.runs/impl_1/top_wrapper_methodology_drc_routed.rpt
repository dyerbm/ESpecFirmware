2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_div_out are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clk_div_out]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_div_out are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clk_div_out]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-8#1 Critical Warning
No common period between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_div_out are found related (timed together) but have no common (expandable) period
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -2.330 ns between top_i/axi_gpio_1/U0/gpio_core_1/Not_Dual.gpio_Data_Out_reg[0]_replica/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and top_i/selectio_wiz_0/inst/pins[0].iserdese2_master/BITSLIP (clocked by clk_div_out). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -2.334 ns between top_i/axi_gpio_1/U0/gpio_core_1/Not_Dual.gpio_Data_Out_reg[0]_replica/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and top_i/selectio_wiz_0/inst/pins[0].iserdese2_slave/BITSLIP (clocked by clk_div_out). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on spi_rtl_io0_io relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_0
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on spi_rtl_io1_io relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_0
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on spi_rtl_sck_io relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_0
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on spi_rtl_ss_io[0] relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_0
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1959#1 Advisory
connects_SERDES_RST_driver_not_FF  
top_i/selectio_wiz_0/inst/pins[0].iserdese2_master: The RST pin should only be driven by a Flip-flop.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1959#2 Advisory
connects_SERDES_RST_driver_not_FF  
top_i/selectio_wiz_0/inst/pins[0].iserdese2_slave: The RST pin should only be driven by a Flip-flop.
Related violations: <none>
