2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_div_out are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clk_div_out]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_div_out are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clk_div_out]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-8#1 Critical Warning
No common period between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_div_out are found related (timed together) but have no common (expandable) period
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-15#1 Warning
Large hold violation  
There is a large clock skew of 3.904 ns between data_in_from_pins_p_0[0] (clocked by diff_clk_in_0_clk_p) and top_i/selectio_wiz_0/inst/pins[0].iserdese2_master/DDLY (clocked by diff_clk_in_0_clk_p) that results in large hold timing violation(s) of -2.441 ns. Fixing large hold violations during routing might impact setup slack and result in more difficult timing closure
Related violations: <none>

There is a large clock skew of 3.912 ns between data_in_from_pins_p_0[3] (clocked by diff_clk_in_0_clk_p) and top_i/selectio_wiz_0/inst/pins[3].iserdese2_master/DDLY (clocked by diff_clk_in_0_clk_p) that results in large hold timing violation(s) of -2.446 ns. Fixing large hold violations during routing might impact setup slack and result in more difficult timing closure
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-15#3 Warning
Large hold violation  
There is a large clock skew of 3.913 ns between data_in_from_pins_p_0[1] (clocked by diff_clk_in_0_clk_p) and top_i/selectio_wiz_0/inst/pins[1].iserdese2_master/DDLY (clocked by diff_clk_in_0_clk_p) that results in large hold timing violation(s) of -2.450 ns.
