2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_div_out are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clk_div_out]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_div_out are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clk_div_out]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-8#1 Critical Warning
No common period between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_div_out are found related (timed together) but have no common (expandable) period
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-15#1 Warning
Large hold violation  
There is a large clock skew of 3.904 ns between data_in_from_pins_p_0[0] (clocked by diff_clk_in_0_clk_p) and top_i/selectio_wiz_0/inst/pins[0].iserdese2_master/DDLY (clocked by diff_clk_in_0_clk_p) that results in large hold timing violation(s) of -2.441 ns. Fixing large hold violations during routing might impact setup slack and result in more difficult timing closure
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-15#2 Warning
Large hold violation  
There is a large clock skew of 3.913 ns between data_in_from_pins_p_0[1] (clocked by diff_clk_in_0_clk_p) and top_i/selectio_wiz_0/inst/pins[1].iserdese2_master/DDLY (clocked by diff_clk_in_0_clk_p) that results in large hold timing violation(s) of -2.450 ns. Fixing large hold violations during routing might impact setup slack and result in more difficult timing closure
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -3.463 ns between top_i/axi_gpio_1/U0/gpio_core_1/Not_Dual.gpio_Data_Out_reg[1]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and top_i/selectio_wiz_0/inst/pins[0].iserdese2_master/BITSLIP (clocked by clk_div_out). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -3.541 ns between top_i/axi_gpio_1/U0/gpio_core_1/Not_Dual.gpio_Data_Out_reg[0]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and top_i/selectio_wiz_0/inst/pins[1].iserdese2_master/BITSLIP (clocked by clk_div_out). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -3.609 ns between top_i/proc_sys_reset_0/U0/PR_OUT_DFF[0].FDRE_PER_replica/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and top_i/selectio_wiz_0/inst/pins[0].iserdese2_master/RST (clocked by clk_div_out). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#4 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -3.925 ns between top_i/proc_sys_reset_0/U0/PR_OUT_DFF[0].FDRE_PER/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and top_i/selectio_wiz_0/inst/pins[1].iserdese2_master/RST (clocked by clk_div_out). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on spi_rtl_io0_io relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of clk_fpga_0.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on spi_rtl_io1_io relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of clk_fpga_0.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on spi_rtl_io0_io relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of clk_fpga_0.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on spi_rtl_io1_io relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of clk_fpga_0.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#5 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on spi_rtl_sck_io relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of clk_fpga_0.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#6 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on spi_rtl_ss_io[0] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of clk_fpga_0.
Related violations: <none>
