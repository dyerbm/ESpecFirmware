INFO: [Route 35-57] Estimated Timing Summary | WNS=-2.334 | TNS=-4.663 | WHS=-0.909 | THS=-0.909 |

WARNING: [Route 35-328] Router estimated timing not met.
Resolution: For a complete and accurate timing signoff, report_timing_summary must be run after route_design. Alternatively, route_design can be run with the -timing_summary option to enable a complete timing signoff at the end of route_design.
